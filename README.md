# ML-on-graphs

In this repository,you can find the files related to my thesis.I employ java and python to do link prediction inside and outside the graph database Neo4j.The goal is to know which process is faster in terms of execution time.By doing link prediction inside graph database we will not have to move large amount of data outside the database and we expect the process would be faster.
